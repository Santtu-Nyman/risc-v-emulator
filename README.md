# risc-v-emulator
This repository is for my RISC-V GUI emulator and command line disassembler.
The emulator will execute the base instruction set (RV32I) and possibly some of the standard extensions.
I don't know what to do with RV64I yet.
The disassembler will probably support the base instruction set and most the standard extensions.
Both the emulator and the disassembler will run on Windows and Linux.

This project is frozen for now. I am too busy to continue it.
